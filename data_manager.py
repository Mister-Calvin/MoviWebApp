class DataManager():
    """Handles all database operations for users and movies.

    The DataManager class serves as an interface between the Flask routes (app.py)
    and the SQLAlchemy models (models.py). It provides methods for creating, reading,
    updating, and deleting (CRUD) records while ensuring proper error handling and
    transaction safety.

    Each method manages its own database session lifecycle using try/except/finally
    blocks to maintain database stability. Rollbacks are performed automatically
    in case of errors, and sessions are closed after each operation.

    Responsibilities:
    - Manage user and movie records in the SQLite database.
    - Provide reusable, isolated database access methods.
    - Ensure robust exception handling and consistent commit/rollback logic.
    - Maintain a clean separation between application logic and persistence layer."""
